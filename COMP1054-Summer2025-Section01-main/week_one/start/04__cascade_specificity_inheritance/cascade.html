                    <em>The "Tricky" Selectors </em>
                    Now that we've covered the absolute basics (what CSS is, what we can do with it, and how to include
                    it in our HTML documents), we're going to delve a little deeper into how CSS works. To really
                    understand CSS and why certain style rules are applied, it's important to understand the fundamental
                    concepts of the cascade, inheritance, and specificity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>This week </em>, we'll also explore some of the trickier selectors including pseudo-elements and
                    classes,and combinators.Finally, we'll also spend some time this week talking about best practices -
                    how to organize your
                    CSS, how to format your CSS, normalization/reset techniques, and helpful tools to optimize your
                    stylesheets.
